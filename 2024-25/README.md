#### [Lecture 0: Introduction and recap](l00-introduction.ipynb)

This lecture introduces the **[Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)** library as a versatile tool for creating and experimenting with reinforcement learning environments. We will explore the fundamentals of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), modeling real-world problems as MDPs, and creating custom environments in Gymnasium to test and compare these methods. Hands-on examples and coding exercises help bridge theory and practice, offering a clear understanding of how these techniques apply to different scenarios. In particular, we provide a quick recap of the main tabular reinforcement learning methods, including **dynamic programming**, **Monte Carlo**, **SARSA**, and **Q-learning**, by focusing on their implementation.
