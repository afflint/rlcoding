    "Each player of a normal form game has a policy or strategy $\\pi_i$ used to describe their action, this policy defines a probability distribution over the actions, such that player $i$ plays action $a_i$ with probability $\\pi_i(a_i)$. Each player simoultaneously chooses an action according to their probability distribution and the chosen actions together form the _joint action_ $a = (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N)$.

There are **many** notions of equilibrium and Nash equilibrium is one of the toughest to deal with, there are instead larger classes which contain more general notions that are easier to compute, like correlated equilibria, coarse correlated equilibria or generalized Nash equilibria. Furthermore equilibria are interesting to study also for how they transfers over to other types of game, like sequential games (in which the players pick their actions in order, like chess), games where the players don't know exactly the rules of the game or games where the payoff is probabilitic.\n",

    "> We believe that this matter of computational complexity is one of central importance here, and indeed that the algorithmic point of view has much to contribute to the debate of economists about solution concepts. The reason is simple: If an equilibrium concept is not efficiently computable, much of its credibility as a prediction of the behavior of rational agents is lost ‚Äì after all, there is no clear reason why a group of agents cannot be simulated by a machine. Efficient computability is an important modeling perequisite for solution concepts. In the words of Kamal Jain, ‚ÄúIf your laptop cannot find it, neither can the market.‚Äù"
