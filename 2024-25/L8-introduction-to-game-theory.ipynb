    "In the previous lesson, we discovered why switching from single agent to multiple agents can be challenging. In this lesson we try to model multi-agent interaction with meaningful theoretical models. We start with **normal form games** which descrive _one-shot_ interactions between multiple agents with no evolving environment and provide the necessary foundations to understand the objective and problems, then we switch to **stochastic games** that model multiple interactions between a group of agents in an evolving environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each player of a normal form game has a policy $\\pi_i$ used to describe their action, this policy defines a probability distribution over the actions, such that player $i$ plays action $a_i$ with probability $\\pi_i(a_i)$. Each player simoultaneously chooses an action according their probability distribution and the chosen actions together form the _joint action_ $a = (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N)$. The reward given to each player depends on the joint action $r_i(a)$, not on any player's action alone.\n",

    "The prisoner's dilemma is a classic example of general-sum normal form game. Andrea and Bryan are two not very good criminals that get caught and put in separate cells. Fortunately for them, there is not enough evicence for a full conviction. After questioning, the officer separately tells them that they can either **collaborate** with the police by confessing to the crime or remain **silent**. If only one confesses, they get out of prison, but the other is sentenced to 10 years in jail. If both confess, they get 8 years each. If both stay silent, the police has makes a minor conviction of 1 year each.\n",

In the end the best play seems to be to confess regardless.\n",

    "This game was studies under the lens of philosophy. From _\"The prisoner's dilemma paradox: rationality, morality, and reciprocity\"_ by Rory W. Collins:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Several philosophers have advanced a case for staying silent on rational grounds called the symmetry argument (Bicchieri and Green Reference Bicchieri, Green, Holmström-Hintikka and Tuomela1997). The general idea is that Andrea knows she and Bryan are both rational agents, so whatever choice she arrives at, Bryan will also reach, since two rational agents will reason symmetrically. This reduces the four possibilities to just two: both confess or both stay silent. Of these, the latter is clearly preferable, so Andrea should remain silent, confident that Bryan will too.\n",
