Examples for the RL course



## Code organization

The repository is organized in packages. Each package is about one of the course topics plus other materials and examples. Each package is composed by two main Python modules, namely `models` and `algorithms`. In addition, some `Jupyter` notebooks are included in each package to test the code.

### List of packages

- `ddp`: **deterministic decision processes**. Introduction to search problems and dynamic programming
- `mdp`: **Markov decision processes**. Modeling MDP, policy evaluation and value iteration.
