## Repository organization

Materials are organized by Academic Year.

Coding is implemented using the Python libraries [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for setting up the virtual environment and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing dependencies. 

AY 2023-24 **lecture notes** from Prof. Alfio Ferrara are available in the `2023-24.lnotes` folder. These documents are **frequently updated**, thus stay tuned with the last versions.

For AY 2023-24, the code follows two approaches:

1. Implementing environment, models and algorithms **from scratch** (mainly for teaching purposes). This is stored in the folder `2023-24.code`. For some of the examples of coding from scratch for tabular methods, we exploit the [relearn](https://github.com/umilISLab/relearn) package, produced by Elisabetta Rocchetti for the [ISLab](https://islab.di.unimi.it/) group.
2. Code implemented using the [gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library, stored in the package `2023-24.gymp.gymp`
